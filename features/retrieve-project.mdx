# Retrieve Project

This guide explains how to retrieve an existing project using the BlendDuck SDK.

## Usage

To retrieve a project, you'll use the `projects.get()` method of the BlendDuck client. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Initialize the BlendDuck client
2. Call the `projects.get()` method with the project ID
3. Use the returned project object

Here's an example:

```typescript
import BlendDuck from "@blendduck/node-sdk";

async function retrieveProject(projectId: string) {
  // Initialize the BlendDuck client
  const client = new BlendDuck({
    apiKey: process.env.BLENDDUCK_API_KEY
  });

  try {
    // Retrieve the project
    const project = await client.projects.get(projectId);

    console.log(`Retrieved project: ${project.title}`);
    console.log(`Number of clips: ${project.clips.length}`);

    // You can now work with the project object
    // For example, you can access its properties:
    console.log(`Project aspect ratio: ${project.ratio}`);
    console.log(`Project theme: `, project.theme);

    return project;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error retrieving project:", error);
  }
}

// Usage
retrieveProject("your-project-id-here");
```

## Return Value

The `projects.get()` method returns a Promise that resolves to a `Project` object. This object contains all the properties of your project, including:

- `id`: The unique identifier of the project
- `title`: The title of the project
- `ratio`: The aspect ratio of the project
- `share`: Whether the project is shared or not
- `theme`: The global theme settings of the project
- `clips`: An array of `Clip` objects representing the video clips in the project

## Error Handling

If the project cannot be found or there's an issue with the API request, the method will throw an error. It's good practice to wrap the call in a try-catch block to handle any potential errors gracefully.

## Best Practices

1. **Error Handling**: Always implement error handling to manage cases where the project might not exist or there are network issues.
2. **Caching**: If you're retrieving the same project frequently, consider implementing caching to reduce API calls.
3. **Permissions**: Ensure that your API key has the necessary permissions to retrieve projects.
