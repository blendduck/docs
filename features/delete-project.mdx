# Delete Project

This guide explains how to delete an existing project using the BlendDuck SDK.

## Usage

To delete a project, you'll use the `projects.delete()` method of the BlendDuck client. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Initialize the BlendDuck client
2. Call the `projects.delete()` method with the project ID
3. Handle the response

Here's an example:

```typescript
import BlendDuck from "@blendduck/node-sdk";

async function deleteProject(projectId: string) {
  // Initialize the BlendDuck client
  const client = new BlendDuck({
    apiKey: process.env.BLENDDUCK_API_KEY
  });

  try {
    // Delete the project
    await client.projects.delete(projectId);

    console.log(`Project deleted successfully! ID: ${projectId}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error deleting project:", error);
  }
}

// Usage
deleteProject("your-project-id-here");
```

## Return Value

The `projects.delete()` method returns a Promise that resolves when the deletion is successful. It doesn't return any specific value.

## Error Handling

If there's an issue with deleting the project or with the API request, the method will throw an error. It's good practice to wrap the call in a try-catch block to handle any potential errors gracefully. Common errors might include:

- Project not found
- Insufficient permissions
- Network errors

## Best Practices

1. **Confirmation**: Always confirm with the user before deleting a project, as this action is irreversible.
2. **Cascading Deletes**: Be aware that deleting a project will also delete all associated clips, elements, and other resources. Make sure this is the intended behavior.
3. **Cleanup**: If you're storing any local references or caches of the project, make sure to clean those up after successful deletion.
4. **Logging**: Consider logging deletion actions for audit purposes.
5. **Soft Delete**: If applicable to your use case, consider implementing a "soft delete" feature in your application layer, where projects are marked as deleted but not immediately removed from the system.

## Safety Measures

To prevent accidental deletions, you might want to implement additional safety measures in your application:

1. Require a confirmation step before deletion
2. Implement a "trash" system where deleted projects can be recovered for a certain period
3. Add a delay between the delete request and the actual deletion
