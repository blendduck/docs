| name | string | - | A short name for the audio track |

## Usage

Here's an example of how to create and add an AudioPlay object to a clip:

```typescript
import BlendDuck, { Clip, AudioPlay } from "@blendduck/node-sdk";

// Create a new clip
const clip = new Clip(10); // 10-second clip

// Create an audio track
const backgroundMusic = new AudioPlay({
  url: "https://s.blendduck.com/audios/motivation.mp3",
  name: "Background Music",
  startTime: 0,
  endTime: 10,
  volume: 0.8
});

// Add the audio track to the clip
clip.addAudioPlay(backgroundMusic);
```

You can create smooth fades in and out by fade properties

```typescript
const backgroundMusic = new AudioPlay({
  url: "https://s.blendduck.com/audios/motivation.mp3",
  name: "Background Music",
  startTime: 0,
  endTime: 10,
  volume: 0.8,
  fade: {
    in: 2, // fade in at the beginning for 2 seconds
    out: 3, // fade out at the end for 3 seconds
  }
});
```
