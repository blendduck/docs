BlendDuck allows users to create professional-quality videos by combining various elements such as text, images, video clips, Lottie animations, and custom widgets.

## Key Features

- **Browser-based Editor**: Create and edit videos directly in your web browser
- **Flexible Element Manipulation**: Add, edit, and animate various elements in your video
- **Builtin Animations**: Easily add animations to your elements with natural easing options
- **Extensiable Widgets**: Ready-made animation widgets help you achieve impressive results in no time

## How It Works

BlendDuck uses a project-based system where each project consists of multiple clips. Each clip can contain various elements (such as text, images, or videos) and animations. You can also set a global theme for your project to maintain consistent styling.

Our platform is built on top of Remotion, providing a powerful and flexible foundation for video creation.

## Next Steps

We're excited to see what you'll create with BlendDuck!
